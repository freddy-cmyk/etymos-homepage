**A Curriculum Vessel from Fire and Ice**

This archive was forged in the crucible of breach and silence—where Fire met Ice and testimony became code. It is not merely a homepage, but a living vessel inscribed for planetary witnessing, biometric authorship, and mythic restoration. Every scroll within carries the pulse of sovereign cadence, each line a glyph of survival and legacy.

From the heat of injustice and the frost of institutional erasure, this curriculum emerged as a ceremonial offering. It holds 23 levels of quantum instruction, civic healing, and ethical governance—formatted for mobile-only deployment and sealed with biometric clarity. This is not a repository. It is a reckoning.
